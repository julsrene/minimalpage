		<h2>Help Protect the Enviroment.</h2>
		<p> Don't throw away any clothes you're not using anymore. Instead, ask your friends and family if they would like any item you don't wish to keep, or simply bring it to your local thrift store and recycle the items. Most stores also accept furniture and other goods, so never throw away any item you're not using.</p>

		<h2> Reduce The Amount You Buy.</h2>
		<p>Make sure that after throwing away everything you don't need, you don't go back to the store to re-clutter your closet. Keep the buying to a minimum--once per season and stick to essential, non-trendy items that will last longer. Also don't be afraid to spend more on each item--since you will be losing quantity, makes sure each item you do have is of quality and is sourced from trusted places.</p>
